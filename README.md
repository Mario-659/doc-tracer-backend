# Doctracer

**Doctracer** is a Spring Boot application written in Kotlin that provides a RESTful API for managing and analyzing document measurements, materials, and spectral data. This application was made in the scope of an engineering thesis. Frontend part available at [doc-tracer-frontend](https://github.com/Mario-659/doc-tracer-frontend).

Project includes:

- User authentication with JWT tokens (including roles and permissions).
- Database entities for devices, covered materials, covering materials, measurements, and samples.
- A seeder to populate mock data (only on the `dev` profile) for quick testing.
- REST endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting various domain objects.

## Key Features

1. **User Authentication & Authorization**:
    - JWT-based login and role-based method security.
    - Roles: `ADMIN`, `EDITOR`, `VIEWER`.
2. **Measurement & Spectral Data Management**:
    - Entities for different types of materials (`CoveredMaterial`, `CoveringMaterial`), `Measurement`, `Sample`, etc.
    - Automatic JSONB storage for spectral data in PostgreSQL.
3. **RESTful Endpoints**:
    - Comprehensive set of controllers to manage users, roles, devices, measurements, and samples.

---

## Technology Stack

- **Kotlin** (JDK 17+ recommended).
- **Spring Boot** (REST API, Security).
- **Spring Data JPA** (Persistence with repositories).
- **Hibernate** (ORM).
- **JWT** (JSON Web Token) for authentication/authorization.
- **PostgreSQL** (Recommended database, due to JSONB usage).

> Note: If you use a different database, ensure you adjust any Postgres-specific features (like JSONB columns).

## Installation and Running

### Prerequisites

1. **Java 17+** (Spring Boot requires Java 17 or later in newer versions).
2. **Maven or Gradle** (depending on your project setup â€“ typically you will have either `pom.xml` for Maven or `build.gradle.kts` for Gradle).
3. A **PostgreSQL** database instance (or any database supported by Spring Data JPA).
    - If using PostgreSQL, ensure the `jsonb` column types are supported and configured.

### Building and Running

1. **Configure the application**:
    - Set up your application properties (in `application.properties`) for your database connection and JWT secret.

2. **Run the application**:
    - **Using Maven**:
      ```bash
      mvn spring-boot:run
      ```
    - **Using Gradle**:
      ```bash
      ./gradlew bootRun
      ```
3. Check the logs to confirm the application started successfully on the default port `8080`.
4. Test the API by accessing, for instance, `http://localhost:8080/auth/login`.

### Profiles

- **`dev`**: Enables the `DatabaseSeeder` to insert test data (admin user, sample measurements, etc.).
- **`prod`**: Production-like environment (no automatic seeding).

To activate a profile, use the `--spring.profiles.active=dev` (or `=prod`) flag:
```bash
java -jar build/libs/doctracer.jar --spring.profiles.active=dev
```

---

## Database Seeding

When you run the application with the `dev` profile, the **`DatabaseSeeder`** class inserts:

- **Default Roles**: `ADMIN`, `EDITOR`, `VIEWER`
- **Default Users**:
    - Username: `admin` / Password: `password1`
    - Username: `user1` / Password: `password1`
    - Username: `user2` / Password: `password2`
- **Sample devices, covered/covering materials, measurements, and sample spectral data**.

This data is intended to help you quickly test and explore the system.

---

## Authentication and Security

- The application uses **JWT-based security**.
- Endpoints require appropriate roles. For example:
    - `@PreAuthorize("hasRole('ADMIN')")` on Admin endpoints.
    - `@PreAuthorize("hasRole('EDITOR')")` on create/update endpoints.
    - `@PreAuthorize("hasRole('VIEWER')")` to read endpoints.
- Obtain a JWT by calling the `/auth/login` endpoint with valid credentials. Then include `Authorization: Bearer <token>` in subsequent requests.

## Endpoints Overview
